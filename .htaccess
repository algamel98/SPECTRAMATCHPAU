# SpectraMatch — .htaccess for JPaaS (Apache + mod_wsgi)
# =============================================================================
#
# This file configures directives that .htaccess is allowed to set.
# NOTE: WSGIDaemonProcess / WSGIProcessGroup / WSGIApplicationGroup directives
# can ONLY be set in server config (httpd.conf), NOT in .htaccess.
# See jpaas/httpd-wsgi.conf for those critical directives.
#
# NOTE: RequestReadTimeout is a server-level directive and is NOT allowed in
# .htaccess on JPaaS.  Set it in httpd.conf instead (see jpaas/httpd-wsgi.conf).
